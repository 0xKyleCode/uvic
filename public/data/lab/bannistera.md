One of the major issues in current radiotherapy (RT) is the normal tissue toxicity. A smart combination of agents within the tumor would allow lowering the RT dose required while minimizing the damage to healthy tissue surrounding the tumor. We chose gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and docetaxel (DTX) as our choice of two radiosensitizing agents. They have a different mechanism of action which could lead to synergistic effect. Our first goal was to assess the variation in GNP uptake, distribution, and retention in the presence of DTX. Our second goal was to assess the therapeutic results of the triple combination, RT/GNPs/DTX.
