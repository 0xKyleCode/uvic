I am a senior undergraduate student in the Honours Physics program at the University of Victoria. Ever since I was in high school, I have always been interested in cancer research and physics. My plan is to use bleomycin as well as gold nanoparticles of 15nm functionalized with a combination of polyethylene glycol and an RBG peptide to reach the curative radiotherapy dose while protecting the surrounding normal tissues. My study will be looking at a combination of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and pancreatic cancer cells (MIA PaCa-2) to see the effectiveness of using this method.
