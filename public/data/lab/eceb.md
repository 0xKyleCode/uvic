I studied superconductive radiofrequency cavities and their cryo-cooling (N2 and LHe) systems in a superconducting linear accelerator based free electron laser machine in my masterâ€™s in Turkey. There were 2 accelerator modules, each has 2 RF cavities, helium vessel and coupler ports for RF waveguides. I performed analysis of installation and commissioning processes for both systems. I also participated in Clean Room applications; installation of FED Class 1000 clear room and process beam line components. My MSc project at University of Victoria involves developing of nanomaterials for both imaging & therapy followed by testing their efficacy using two dimensional and three dimensional tissue models. I will be using linear accelerator for treatment of tumor cells and this will be a great transition from my previous work.
