Preferential introduction of high Z material to tumour cells works as a method of radiation sensitization. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are very useful in this respect. It has been shown that the size, shape, and surface properties of GNPs affect their cellular uptake. Manipulation of the cell cycle to arrest cells at different stages offers a unique strategy to study the molecular and structural events as the cell cycle progresses. To optimize delivery of GNPs into tumour cells and enhance the effect of radiosensitization, nanoparticle (NP) uptake in synchronized populations of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was investigated.
