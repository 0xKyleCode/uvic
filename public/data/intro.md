Cancer is a family of diseases arising from dysregulation of the expression of multiple genes, leading to abnormal cell proliferation and cell death. As a result, there is significant morbidity in patients if left untreated. Before the age of 75, about **1 in 6 people will develop cancer while 1 in 9 will die from it**.

Based at the University of Victoria, the Nanoscience and Technology Laboratory explores methods of improving two of the main modalities present in cancer treatment: radiotherapy and chemotherapy. To achieve this, nanomaterials are being employed. This includes systems such as **Gold Nanoparticles**, **Lipid Nanoparticles**, and other various nanosystems! Our plan is to **reduce normal tissue toxicity** present in radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as improve targeting and overall efficacy towards a better patient outcome!

This lab is multifaceted, utilizing principles found in

    - physics
    - chemistry
    - biology
    - computer science

Understanding the properties of, for example, gold nanoparticles under radiation requires understanding of the complex interactions present. Production and utlization of chemotherapy drugs with the nanoparticles depends upon knowledge of the surface chemistry and beyond. Biology is a necessary component to tie it all together, allowing for experimentation on preclinical cancer models. Finally, computer science allows for Monte Carlo simulating as well as deep learning projects to be explored.
