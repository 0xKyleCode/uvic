Due to recent advances in nanotechnology, the application of nanoparticles (NPs) in cancer therapy has become a leading area in cancer research. Despite the importance of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in creating an optimal niche for tumor cells to grow extensively, most of the work has been focused on tumor cells. Therefore, to effectively use NPs for therapeutic purposes, it is important to elucidate the extent of NP uptake and retention in tumor cells and CAFs.</center></b>
