Dr. Devika Chithrani talked about the endless opportunities of nanotechnology in cancer research. We hope you will enjoy. Our dean, prof. Peter Loock, gave a very kind introduction before my talk. She incorporated her research into teaching as well. To be able to mentor our young generation via both teaching and research is a blessing. She enjoy every minute of it.
