Kyle Bromma was one of the PhD students in our group and he defended his thesis with flying colours today. Congrats to Dr. Kyle Bromma.

Kyle had a very ambitious project and he was able to produce amazing body of work. During this process he published 17 papers in high impact journals in the field. Six of them are first author and 11 of them are co-authored papers. His last first author paper is under review in British Journal of Radiology. His work is highlighted in media as well. This includes "The Conversation", National Post, Daily Beast and so forth. The article published in "The Conversation" became the highest read article in the month it was published.

He won many prestigious scholarships during his graduate studies and won many awards in most of the conferences he participated.

Kyle will be starting his medical Physics residency in July. We have no doubt that he will be successful in anything he wants to do.

We are very lucky to have him as a graduate student.
