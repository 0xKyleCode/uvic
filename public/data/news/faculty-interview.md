This aims at communicating research to a broader community around the world. Dr. Chithrani talked about use of smart nanomedicine in the treatment of cancer. This video is just over 10 minutes. She is very grateful for all the researchers in the field who had contributed immensely and also the ones who are working really hard to make this nanomedicine accessible to more cancer patients in the near future. She did her PhD in Quantum physics and the opportunity to be able to contribute to cancer research is very rewarding.
