This is an <a href="https://www.timescolonist.com/sponsored/uvics-research-focuses-on-low-harm-cancer-treatment-6785208" target="_blank">article</a> published in the Times Colonist newspaper highlighting our research program.

It has been a privilege to be able to collaborate with many outstanding researchers. As Dr. Chithrani said in the article, it is not about competition among us but how we can achieve big targets together. She tries to combine teaching and research together to motivate our next generation. It has been very successful so far.
She never underestimates their potential. They just need good guidance to build that passion within them selves to navigate roadblocks. She uses her story as a tool.
We hope you will enjoy this article.
